# Iris Flower Dataset Analysis and Classification

This project demonstrates the analysis and classification of the Iris Flower dataset using various machine learning algorithms.


## About

The Iris Flower Dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. It contains samples of three species of iris flowers with their respective feature measurements. This project aims to showcase the process of loading, exploring, preprocessing, and applying machine learning algorithms to classify the iris flowers.

## Dataset Overview

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples, each with the following four features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

The goal is to classify each sample into one of three species:
1. Setosa
2. Versicolour
3. Virginica

## Results
The accuracy scores of the trained models on the test dataset are as follows:

Logistic Regression: [0.98113]
Decision Tree: [0.98113]
Random Forest: [1]
SVM: [1]
Naive Bayes: [0.9777]
kNN: [0.98113]
Detailed insights, visualizations, and comparisons can be found in the notebooks.
